# Massive
The great never-ending project

A project covering several aspects of everything, with the purpose of slowly growing to be a complete library for whateveryouneed. I might have taken inspiration from the AForge framework. Shh.

While currently a hobby project, probably with a number of bugs that would require a Massive.Mathematics.Numerics.Natural to represent, I'll still answer questions and review pull requests. Feel free to contribute or use the library (hopefully with a link to this repo in your UI) :)
